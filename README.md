# Super-Store-Sales-dashboard
This Power BI dashboard presents a comprehensive overview of sales performance across different product segments, categories, and shipping/payment modes, specifically for the Central Region.
After diving deep into data, design, and storytelling, I’m excited to share my Super Store Sales Dashboard, built using Power BI. This dashboard tracks key 
performance indicators like:
✅ Total Sales: ₹341.01K
 ✅ Profit: ₹27.45K
 ✅ Quantity Sold: 5,239
 ✅ Avg. Delivery Days: 4.04
🔍 What you'll find inside:
Year-over-year sales & profit trends 📈
Best-selling categories and subcategories
Regional sales & profit performance (mapped!)
Deep dive into shipping and payment modes
Segment-wise sales breakdown to identify your best customer types

💡 Key Insight: Q4 2020 showed a strong surge in both sales and profit—highlighting the impact of end-of-year buying behavior and strategic promotions.
